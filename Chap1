As I am reading Chapter 1 , in the "How much Can We Scale" section , I see a wrong number :
A computing intensive Example
[ I suppose that the writer still considers the case of 200 GBytes of data to be proccessed]
    Now imagine that we have 4000 nodes, and magically each node reads its own 500 MB of data from a local disk
that should be changed to:
    Now imagine that we have 4000 nodes, to proccess these 200GBytes, and magically each node reads its own 50 MB 
    of data from a local disk 
OR 
    Now imagine that we have 400 nodes, to proccess these 200GBytes, and magically each node reads its own 500 MB 
    of data from a local disk
