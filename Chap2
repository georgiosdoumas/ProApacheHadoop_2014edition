Figure 2-1
under "The Reduce" process on the right side ,
in the lower  Shuffle and Sort
  Key3 has only ValueA ,
but the correct would be to have another line under it wiht the second key/value pair of
  Key3 Value6
and then continue with
  Key5 ValueB
and at the same time delete on the upper Shuffle and Sort , the
  key6 ValueC
which did not exist under The Map

OR
maybe the writers want to have all keys form 1 to 8 , in this case :
on The Map :
change  Key3 Value6  --> Key6 ValueC
and no correction on The Reduce.
